  short_description: "Interview requirements and build execution-ready plans"
  default_prompt: "Use $tech-planner to create an execution-ready technical plan at <runtime-root>/plans with PlanSpec v2 and measurable acceptance criteria (`runtime-root=${SIGEE_RUNTIME_ROOT:-.codex}`). For non-trivial work, call `update_plan` first and maintain a 3-7 step plan using statuses `pending`, `in_progress`, `completed` (exactly one `in_progress` step at a time), updating it at each milestone and finishing with all steps `completed`. Before finalizing the plan, enforce `.sigee` gitignore policy by running the guard (`scripts/sigee_gitignore_guard.sh`) via plan_lint flow. Explain decisions in long-form, content-first language before IDs or paths. For handoff, do not output a next-command line; output one copy-ready markdown fenced block titled `다음 실행 프롬프트` that asks $tech-developer to run strict execution (DAG-first when scenarios exist, otherwise codex_flow strict). Mention persistent report generation only when explicitly requested."
