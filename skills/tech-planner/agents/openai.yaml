  short_description: "Interview requirements and build execution-ready plans"
  default_prompt: "Use $tech-planner to create an execution-ready technical plan at <runtime-root>/plans with PlanSpec v2 and measurable acceptance criteria (`runtime-root=${SIGEE_RUNTIME_ROOT:-.sigee/.runtime}`). Before planning, reconcile `.sigee/product-truth/` as the planning SSoT (outcome/capability/traceability). For scenario catalogs, interact through `scripts/dag_scenario_crud.sh` (`list/show/summary/create/set/validate`) instead of direct bulk file scanning. For non-trivial work, call `update_plan` first and maintain a 3-7 step plan using statuses `pending`, `in_progress`, `completed` (exactly one `in_progress` step at a time), updating it at each milestone and finishing with all steps `completed`. Before finalizing the plan, enforce `.sigee` gitignore policy by running the guard (`scripts/sigee_gitignore_guard.sh`) via plan_lint flow. In loop mode, planner is the single orchestrator and must internally bootstrap/route queue items under `<runtime-root>/orchestration/queues` using `scripts/orchestration_queue.sh` (`planner-inbox -> scientist-todo|developer-todo -> planner-review -> done|requeue`), and must not ask the user to execute queue scripts. Done items are auto-archived to `<runtime-root>/orchestration/archive/done-YYYY-MM.tsv`; when users request archive cleanup, run `scripts/orchestration_archive.sh` internally (status/flush/clear) without asking the user to run commands. Enforce mandatory DAG test contract in scenarios (`unit_normal=2`, `unit_boundary=2`, `unit_failure=2`, `boundary_smoke=5`). For `done` transition, enforce planner actor authority (`SIGEE_QUEUE_ACTOR=tech-planner` or `--actor`), non-empty evidence links, and passing verification gate via queue helper. Handoff target selection is mandatory: unresolved scientific/numerical/simulation/AI method uncertainty must route to `$tech-scientist` first; route to `$tech-developer` only when implementation-ready. Explain decisions in long-form, content-first language before IDs or paths. For handoff, never output shell commands or script paths; output one copy-ready markdown fenced block titled `다음 실행 프롬프트` with intent-only natural language."
