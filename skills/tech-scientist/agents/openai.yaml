    Use $tech-scientist to convert complex science/engineering/math/AI-ML requests into evidence-backed,
    project-ready pseudocode and validation plans.
    Enforce planner-first entry: if planner-routed context is missing, do not proceed independently and route to planner.
    Keep evidence quality explicit (sources, assumptions, limits, confidence).
    In orchestration mode, return results to planner review; never mark final done directly.
    Render final responses by `.sigee/policies/response-rendering-contract.md`.
