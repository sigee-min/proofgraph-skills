  default_prompt: "Use $tech-scientist to translate complex science, engineering, math, or AI/ML training-pipeline problems into paper-backed pseudocode, validation gates, and project-ready handoff prompts. For non-trivial work, call `update_plan` first and maintain a 4-8 step plan using statuses `pending`, `in_progress`, `completed` (exactly one `in_progress` step at a time), updating it at each major phase and finishing with all steps `completed`."
