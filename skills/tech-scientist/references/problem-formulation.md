# Problem Formulation Template

Use this before any algorithm recommendation.

## 1) Problem Statement
- Business/scientific objective:
- Target phenomenon/system:
- Required outputs:

## 2) Inputs and Data Contract
- Input variables and units:
- Data ranges and expected distributions:
- Missing/noisy data handling:

## 3) Constraints
- Hard constraints (safety/physics/regulatory):
- Runtime/latency budget:
- Memory/compute budget:
- Precision/tolerance requirement:

## 4) Mathematical Formulation
- Decision variables:
- Objective function(s):
- Governing equations (if any):
- Boundary/initial conditions:

## 5) Acceptance Criteria
- Quantitative success metrics:
- Failure criteria:
- Minimum reproducibility requirement:

## 6) Applicability Flags
- Is this online/realtime or offline/batch?
- Determinism required?
- Explainability required?
