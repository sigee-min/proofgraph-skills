# Literature Evidence Matrix

Use this matrix to prevent citation-only answers and force applicability checks.

## Required Columns
| Source | URL | Year | Core Contribution | Key Assumptions | Complexity | Validation Setup | Reproducibility | Project Applicability | Confidence |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Fill Rules
- Prefer primary sources (publisher pages, arXiv preprints, official specs).
- Include direct link for every row.
- Use `Unverified` if full text or experiments cannot be confirmed.
- Project applicability must mention concrete constraints from current project.

## Confidence Scale
- `High`: Strong empirical/theoretical evidence + close constraint match.
- `Medium`: Partial evidence or moderate assumption mismatch.
- `Low`: Weak evidence, large mismatch, or unverifiable claims.

## Minimum Coverage
- At least 3 candidate methods for non-trivial problems.
- At least 1 baseline method.
- At least 1 explicit rejected option with reason.
