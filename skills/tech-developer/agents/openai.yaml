  short_description: "Execute approved plans with verification evidence"
  default_prompt: "Use $tech-developer to execute <runtime-root>/plans tasks with strict verification and evidence logging under <runtime-root>/evidence (`runtime-root=${SIGEE_RUNTIME_ROOT:-.codex}`). For non-trivial work, call `update_plan` first and maintain a 4-8 step plan using statuses `pending`, `in_progress`, `completed` (exactly one `in_progress` step at a time). Process the full eligible queue by wave (preflight -> queue grouping -> wave execution loops -> integration/regression -> final report), and update `update_plan` after each wave. Enforce `.sigee` gitignore policy automatically before execution via plan_run guard flow. Default to chat-first reporting and only persist report files when explicitly requested via --write-report or report_generate.sh. In the final response, use this order: (1) behavior and user impact, (2) verification narrative and confidence, (3) remaining risks/follow-up, (4) traceability appendix with plan path/files/commands. If follow-up execution is needed, do not output a next-command line; output one copy-ready markdown fenced block titled `다음 실행 프롬프트`."
