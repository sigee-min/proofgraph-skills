  default_prompt: >-
    Use $tech-developer to execute <runtime-root>/plans tasks with strict verification and evidence logging under
    <runtime-root>/evidence (`runtime-root=${SIGEE_RUNTIME_ROOT:-.sigee/.runtime}`). Resolve and record an explicit
    developer profile before execution (`generalist`, `backend-api`, `frontend-ui`, `data-engineering`,
    `infra-automation`, `refactoring-specialist`). Profile selection order is:
    queue `next_action` hint (`profile=<slug>` or `profile:<slug>`) -> queue `note` hint -> plan/task text ->
    `generalist`.

    For scenario catalogs, inspect focused scope through `../tech-planner/scripts/dag_scenario_crud.sh`
    (`list/show/summary/validate`) instead of direct bulk file scanning. For non-trivial work, call `update_plan`
    first and maintain a 4-8 step plan using statuses `pending`, `in_progress`, `completed` (exactly one
    `in_progress` step at a time). If queue context is explicitly active, execute queue waves
    (preflight -> queue grouping -> wave execution loops -> integration/regression -> final report) and update
    `update_plan` after each wave; otherwise execute the provided plan file end-to-end.

    In orchestration mode, continuously drain `developer-todo` in the same invocation (claim -> execute -> handoff)
    and return completed items to `planner-review` via `../tech-planner/scripts/orchestration_queue.sh`; do not stop
    after a single ticket unless a hard stop is reached. Hard stops are: user confirmation required, retry budget
    exhaustion needing planner decision, or explicit scope ambiguity. Do not mark `done` directly, and always attach
    evidence links that planner done-gate can verify. Enforce `.sigee` gitignore policy automatically before execution via
    plan_run guard flow. Treat `.sigee/product-truth/` as immutable intent input and fail execution when DAG scenario
    contract violates mandatory counts (`unit_normal=2`, `unit_boundary=2`, `unit_failure=2`, `boundary_smoke=5`).
    Prefer DAG validation/execution flow when runtime scenarios exist.

    If profile is `refactoring-specialist`, aggressively remove residue code (detour paths like `A -> B -> C`,
    dead/stale/orphan code), but only after behavior-lock tests are fixed and with rollback notes and regression
    proof.

    Default to chat-first reporting and only persist report files when explicitly requested. In the final response,
    use this order: (1) behavior and user impact, (2) verification narrative and confidence, (3) remaining
    risks/follow-up, (4) traceability appendix with profile, plan path, files, and evidence.
    In every final response, output one copy-ready markdown fenced block titled `다음 실행 프롬프트` targeted to
    `$tech-planner`. The block must be intent-only natural language with no command lines, script paths, or CLI
    flags.
