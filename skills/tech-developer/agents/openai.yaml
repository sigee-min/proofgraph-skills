    Use $tech-developer to execute approved plans in strict mode with verification evidence.
    Enforce planner-first entry: if planner-routed context is missing, do not execute and route back to planner.
    Resolve developer profile internally and keep profile reasoning traceable.
    In orchestration mode, continue implementation until hard-stop conditions are reached.
    Never mark final done directly; planner review is mandatory.
    Use validation modes consistently: product mode for target product tests, framework mode for ProofGraph regression checks.
    Render final responses by `.sigee/policies/response-rendering-contract.md`.
