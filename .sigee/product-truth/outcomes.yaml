    title: "Production-grade planner-centric orchestration loop"
    statement: "Planner, scientist, and developer loops execute deterministic DAG work with evidence-gated completion and observable runtime state."
    status: "active"
    evidence_required:
      - "Queue transition gates enforce planner-only done and PASS evidence requirements."
      - "DAG execution emits machine-readable state and trace artifacts."
      - "Synthetic scale scenarios (50, 200, 500 nodes) run under defined performance budgets."
      - "Developer profile routing and refactoring-specialist cleanup gates preserve behavior while reducing residue code."
      - "Runtime orchestration executes equivalently on macOS/Linux/Windows without OS-specific behavior divergence."
    notes: "Aligned to external architecture review feedback on 2026-02-26."
